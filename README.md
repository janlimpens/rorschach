# rorschach
A command line tool to generate random word combinations

This is a very simple script that takes a list of words or expressions from a text file
and jumbles them randomly. This can be useful to kick start your writing process or to generate passwords.

## How to use it

* Download rorschach.py to your folder of choice.
* Go there on your terminal (command line).
* Execute [python rorschach.py -h] to see instructions. Arguments are optional, there are some defaults in place.
* Execute [python rorschach.py] to generate a items.txt file, where you put in your list of expressions, one per line. Save this file.
* Now, when you run [python rorschach.py] again, you will get a list of jumbled expressions.
