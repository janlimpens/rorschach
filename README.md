# rorschach
A command line tool to generate random word combinations.

This is a very simple script that takes a list of words or expressions from a text file
and jumbles them randomly. This can be useful to kick start your writing process, to generate passwords or to spice up your shopping list experience.

## How to use it

* Download [rorschach.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janlimpens/rorschach/master/rorschach.py) to your folder of choice.
* Go there on your terminal (command line). You need to have Python installed (may not be there on Windows, but I am not sure).
* Execute `python rorschach.py -h` to see instructions. Arguments are optional, there are some defaults in place.
* Execute `python rorschach.py` to generate a items.txt file, if it is not already there, where you can put in your  expressions, one per line. Save this file.
* Now, when you run `python rorschach.py` again, you will get a list of jumbled expressions.
